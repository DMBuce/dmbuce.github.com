<div class="paragraph"><p>The only known continent on the world of <a href="gods.html#gairra">Gairra</a>,
Noedia&#8217;s landscape is diverse and extensive.
To the north, past the
<a href="#sawtooth_mountains">Sawtooth Mountains</a>, giant half-demons brave the
frigid ice of <a href="#gurmong">Gurmong</a>. South of
the peaks of the Sawteeth, a fragmented society rules the coast of the
Salt Sea, until civilization wanes to the barren desert of
<a href="#kharad">Kharad</a>.
To the west of all this, the endless plains of <a href="#rolann">Rolann</a> disappear

<h2 id="gurmong">Gurmong</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_history">History</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Inhospitable to all but the most hardy of life, the only people of this
vast, frozen wasteland are the Gurmong clans. These fierce, savage
people are bound to <a href="gods.html#demon_kings">demonic</a> pacts made by their
ancestors long
ago. Originally forged to stave off invasion, the pacts give the
Gurmong the power to destroy their enemies with satanic magic and brutish
strength. This power comes with a price, though. The Dark Arts have tainted
the clans with a powerful wickedness, staining their character with dreadful
sins. Such is the curse that all Gurmong bear.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_culture">Culture</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each clan is named for the demon they share a bloodpact with, and has
either adapted to the curse bestowed upon them, or perished to it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with gluttony, the Moloch Clan never preserve or stockpile food,
instead hunting only what&#8217;s needed each day and culling their vast herds of
reindeer when food is scarce. Their fat, blubbery warriors use their weight to
deal massive, devastating blows.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with greed, the Mammon Clan have rejected all
notions of personal property, so that their desire for material wealth
is directed at the other clans and does not lead to infighting. The hoard
of goods they&#8217;ve bartered and stolen from other tribes is strapped to the
backs of their mastodon caravan. Their warriors are relentless, shrugging off
damage even as they deal it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with treachery, the Beelzebub Clan are frequent liars. They are a
taciturn people that place little weight on words, being more trustful of a
man&#8217;s actions than his tongue. Their warriors are smaller in stature than the
warriors of other clans, but can strike their enemies down with painful
hellfire.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with wrath, the Baal Clan roam the icy tundra on an endless hunt
astride their sabre-toothed war cats, feeding their bloodlust by killing any
living creature they come across. Their warriors wield massive oversized
weapons, striking down any who stand in their path.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with sloth, the Berith Clan perished in the harsh,
cold climate of Gurmong, unable to survive due to their apathy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with envy, the Gaap Clan tore themselves apart, murdering each
other to extinction due to their covetous nature. The few surviving members
have integrated into other clans.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cursed with vanity, the Lucifer Clan have also been destroyed. They were
ambushed and wiped out by the Gaap Clan during a squabble over the chief&#8217;s
throne.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_races">Races</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Though the Gurmong were once human, few children in this icy land
are born without the taint of their ancestor&#8217;s blood pact. Most of them have
devilish features including horns, pointed teeth, reddish or purplish skin,
and eyes of solid black, red, white, or gold. Some grow to be
<a href="races.html#goliaths">goliaths</a>, standing over seven feet tall with short
horns and stubby tails. Others become <a href="races.html#tieflings">tieflings</a>,
having the stature of a human, elongated horns, and long, thick tails. A scant
few scattered clans retain pure human blood, but their numbers are dwindling.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="races.html#humans">Human</a>, <a href="races.html#minotaurs">minotaur</a>, centaur
and orc tribes roam the endless Rolann
plains. They live with nature, breathe with nature, and in death, become
nature. Their spirit, and the spirits of the animals, plants, and
stones around them, come and pass with the
<a href="gods.html#the_mother_spirit">Mother Spirit</a>. It is
this spirit that they revere and protect. The Mother Spirit returns
their kindness with power. The shamans have the power to speak with the
spirit world. The hunters have the power to draw strength from the
land. And the warriors have the power to become wild beasts.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_culture_2">Culture</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Though the Mother Spirit is kind, her children are fickle. A Rolanni
must protect his tribe, just as he protects the Mother Spirit. He must
honor his tribe, just as he honors the Mother Spirit. Both honor and
protection are won in battle, fighting for food, fighting for security,
fighting for glory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of the many tribes in this region, five are most feared. They are the
Bear Tribe, who have the solitary temperament of a grizzly bear; the
the Owl Tribe, possessing the stealth of an owl in flight; the Elk Tribe,
whose strength in numbers make for a formidable foe; the Wolf Tribe,
cunning and tactful as a canine; and the Panther Clan, named for their
catlike agility.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_history_2">History</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Although there are many tribes today, they were united twice in history.
The first
time was when the gods were new, and the tribes were simply the Tribe.
The Tribe invaded the cities to the east. By doing this, civilization
invaded Rolanni life. The Tribe splintered, their chiefs were defeated,
and the cities were lost.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second time the Rolanni fought as one, the enemy was civilization
again. The city <a href="regions.html#gotheos">Gotheos</a> built an empire, for they
wanted the plains
for their fields. But Rolann does not belong to the sickle and the
plow. It belongs to the fish and the birds and the beasts. It belongs
to the Mother Spirit. Because the fish and the birds and the beasts
could not fight, the Rolanni fought for them. They fought for the
Mother Spirit, and the Mother Spirit saw victory.</p></div>

whose curious nature
drives the invention of wondrous animated constructs and marvelous
clockwork machinery; the <a href="races.html#elves">wood elves</a> of unseen canopy

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nestled in a valley at the heart of <a href="#sylvia">Sylvia</a>, Nirifal is home to
some
of the most skillful artisans, orators, and craftsmen in Noedia. The ruler
of this regal <a href="races.html#elves">elven</a> city has reigned for centuries,
nurturing the growth and sophistication of its culture.
The lifelike paintings, soul-stirring poetry, elegant architecture, and
centuries-old wine produced here are world-renowned thanks to the infinite
patience and skillful magery of the elves.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Built smack-dab in the middle of <a href="#sylvia">Sylvia</a> on an island at the center
of Whorl Lake, this <a href="races.html#gnomes">gnomish</a> city is full of miraculous
marvels and
marvelous miracles. Hapless visitors wind up lost a lot, cuz if you
travel east in the city for long enough, you&#8217;ll end up traveling west.
Perched on the bay of the town, the market overlooks both the sunrise

do with the oddball inventors and magicians who make all manner of
clockwork gadgets and automated widgets.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Called the Beartooth Mountains by the Gurmong and the Orvayne Mountains by

<h3 id="_dwarves">Dwarves</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Deep within these mountains, the Kingdom of <a href="races.html#dwarves">Dwarves</a>

halls and lofty chambers of the dwarves serve as monuments to the
masonry, smithing, and mining in their blood and bones.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_goblins">Goblins</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The dwarves' sinister neighbors are the goblins, whose sprawling caves
wind through the Sawteeth like writhing snakes. These foul creatures
continually expand the reach of their tangled passages, often haplessly
tunneling into a dwarven hall. The ensuing battles are invariably
fought with well-orchestrated military tactics on the dwarves part, and
reckless, frenzied swarms on the part of the goblins.</p></div>

<a href="guilds.html#cathedral_of_palad">Cathedral of Palad</a>, Gotheos is an
impressive sight. Statues, idols,
and murals of <a href="gods.html#thrinn">Thrinn</a> and <a href="gods.html#palad">Palad</a>,
the city&#8217;s patron deities,
decorate the streets. The citizens of this city place great faith in
the wisdom of their leaders, the clergy of Thrinn, and trust the
strength of their protectors, the Paladins. They, in turn, lead
just and pious lives, defending their subjects in times of need.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_history_3">History</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Gotheos was founded by a man named Thrinn who, above all else, valued
honor and chivalry. He endeavored to create a portal to the immortal
realm, so that the deceased souls of the righteous would no longer be
condemned to Hell. His dying moments were spent completing the Heavenly
Portal.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thrinn was raised to godhood, and followers flocked to the city.
Gotheos soon had a vast and glorious empire. Except for the realms of
<a href="#rolann">Rolann</a>, <a href="#sylvia">Sylvia</a>, and <a href="#gurmong">Gurmong</a>, its
reach spanned the entire
known world, spreading civilization, agriculture, and ideas of honor
and justice.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>No longer able to decide the fate of the dead, <a href="gods.html#death">Death</a>
became bitter
towards Thrinn&#8217;s clergy, and stole their portal. Without the promise of
divine paradise, Gotheos' subjects discarded the virtues of honor and
chivalry, and the Gothean Empire crumbled.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What followed was the War of Reclamation, a military campaign to
reclaim the Heavenly Portal that lasted over 150 years. After many
years of attrition fighting the horrors of Necron Swamp, the clergy
withdrew from the war, fearful of the rise of the tribes of Rolann.</p></div>

skeletons and zombies ruled by its namesake. From within the walls of
his floating castle, <a href="gods.html#death">Death</a> keeps the only gateway to
Heaven that
exists in Noedia, allowing passage only to those souls whom he deems
worthy. To protect his divine portal from the theocracy of

<h2 id="hortan">Hortan</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_culture_5">Culture</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hortan is well-known for its warrior academies, which train armies of
soldiers in the art of swordplay. The most prestigious of these train
the <a href="guilds.html#knights_of_hortan">Knights of Hortan</a>, who serve a King
whose lineage goes back to
the leader of the revolt against Gotheos.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The city is also famous for its magic, for there are few wizards
who don&#8217;t learn their craft in Hortan&#8217;s
<a href="guilds.html#tower_of_high_magicka">Tower of High Magicka</a>. The
streets are lined with everburning torches, local shopkeeps offer
teleportation services, and the Knights of Hortan wield energy-infused
blades.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_history_4">History</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hortan was once the greatest military power in Noedia. Its benevolent
Lords, guided by the wisdom of the wizards of High Magicka, saw
Noedia through an era of peace, protecting small cities and threatening
any would-be aggressors with defeat.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sadly, Hortan&#8217;s might was not to last. The Lords were betrayed by Lord
Terpil, and the ensuing battle crippled its military.
The Archmage of High Magicka assumed power of the city, and gave the
one surviving Lord the title of King of Hortan, a figurehead position
that performs ceremonial duties and leads Hortan&#8217;s once-great military.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Bulltown is a new city, built at the foot of Bull Mountain on
the shores of Lake Pandemonium. This city sprung up around a mining
operation started by a group of wizards from High Magicka, who extract the
latent elemental energy from the lake for their sorcery.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_history_5">History</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Where there is now a lake, a mountain, and a town, there was once only a
lake. Lake Pandemonium is a gate to the underworld, and the elements that
churn within the elemental chaos of Limbo sometimes boil up to its surface.
When time
was still young, the demons of Hell would often use the lake to pass into
the mortal realm, wreaking havoc upon the world. Seeing her children
in distress, Gairra birthed Bull Mountain, a stone guardian
which now guards the gate.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Controlled by the <a href="guilds.html#shadow_stalkers">Shadow Stalkers</a>, Traton is
ruled with impunity by
its self-appointed mayor Tony V. Though the people of Traton have never
seen his face, they&#8217;ve all felt his cold wrath one way or another,
be it by the poverty imposed by his high taxes or the
assassination of a family member.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite its seedy underground and corrupt politics, Traton is the
center of trade and commerce in Noedia. Its position at the mouth of
Serpent River put it at the hub of transportation between inland and
coastal cities.</p></div>

many ships are assailed by pirates near the Merchant Isles. These
pirates usually make port in Hullbreach Harbor, a lawless city owing
its prosperity to its many brothels and taverns.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The pirates themselves have little culture to call their own.
Everything from the clothes on their backs to the ships under their
feet is stolen from the innocent. Perhaps the only thing rightfully
theirs are the flags they fly from their masts, though even they are
printed on swindled cloth with stolen ink.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Even so, a race of lizardmen calling themselves Dragonborn have been
thriving as sailors and windsmiths. Descendants of Luca Grey&#8217;s crew of

Only two cities, Bekha and Vahal, exist in the entire region. In recent

primordial lizards, breeding them for use as beasts of burden, livestock, and
warmounts.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="vahal">Vahal</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Vahal is a flourishing trade city whose golden, onion-domed towers
overlook the Salt Sea. All manner of goods can be found in its bustling
bazaars, from masterfully crafted weapons and armor to wonderfully bred
saurians and slaves. So rich is Vahal that its sultans and merchant
princes have commissioned a tower in Bekha to be built to the sky.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="bekha">Bekha</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At the heart of the desert is Bekha, a city said to be the original
source of life. Eons ago, when Kharad was lush and green,

gave this lakeside city the gift of agriculture. Disaster struck when
<a href="gods.html#elcreus">Elcreus</a>, the God of Weather, became enraged at an act
so heinous

Kharad dried up into desert. Cities starved or collapsed, and only
Bekha and Vahal were spared.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Today, Bekha is but a vassal of Vahal. Its citizens work tirelessly
building the Tower of Bekha, hoping to reach the Great Blue Cloud that
Elcreus is said to rest on. In doing so, they hope to confront Elcreus
and restore Kharad&#8217;s dunes to their former green glory.</p></div>
