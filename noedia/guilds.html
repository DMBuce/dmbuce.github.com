<h2 id="cathedral_of_palad">The Church of Thrinn and Cathedral of Palad</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="regions.html#gotheos">Gotheos</a>, the clergy rule the city with
benevolent justice from
the Church of Thrinn. Here, citizens can seek the wisdom of the priests
and commune with the city&#8217;s patron deities.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the clergy at the Church of Thrinn protect the city&#8217;s spirit, the
holy warriors at the Cathedral of Palad protect the city&#8217;s streets.
These warriors of Palad are known as Paladins, and have a tradition that
started with the War of Reclamation, which they served as soldiers in.
This war to reclaim the Heavenly Portal was fought in vain, for the only
Paladin to have ever laid eyes on the Portal was one Deisus Thrinnchild.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Today, the war is ended and the Paladins serve as peacekeepers, both in
Gotheos and abroad.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note: In the Noedia campaign setting, "Paladin" refers specifically to a
member of the Cathedral of Palad, but holy warriors, divine knights, and
paragons of other gods or creeds still use the paladin class described in
the Player&#8217;s Handbook.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="tower_of_high_magicka">Tower of High Magicka</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This tower of wizards boasts some of the wisest men in Noedia.
Chief among these was Bucephalus, a great mage who founded the Tower of
High Magicka to train others in the art of magic, so that they could
better combat the divine miracles of their Gothean opponents.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Today, the tower is run by the masters of the eight schools of magic.
One of the masters also performs duties as the Archmage of High
Magicka, ruling the city of Hortan. Currently, the
Master of Divination is the Archmage of High Magicka.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="knights_of_hortan">Knights of Hortan</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>A century ago, there were three Houses of the Knights of Hortan, each
of which pledged their allegiance to one of the three Lords of Hortan.
Now, <a href="regions.html#hortan">Hortan</a> is ruled by the Archmage of
<a href="#tower_of_high_magicka">High Magicka</a>, and protected by
the King and his Order of Chimera Knights.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Inheriting the duties of the three previous Houses of Knights, the
Chimera Knights train in one of the three fighting styles passed down
to them. With the crest of a unicorn emblazoned on their platemail,
some knights are expert cavalrymen, commanding their steed as if the
beast were an extension of their body. Others, with the relief of a
dragon on their armor, are masters of close combat, fighting as easily
with a sword as with the fist. Finally, the knights that wear the
insignia of a phoenix train the intellect and acheive a clarity of mind
that gives them unparalleled focus in battle.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="shadow_stalkers">Shadow Stalkers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most infamous crime guild in Noedia, the Shadow Stalkers make their
headquarters in <a href="regions.html#traton">Traton</a>. The city is infested with
them, corrupt to
the core with all manner of assassins and thieves. Their leader, a
mysterious figure by the name of Tony V., rules the city as
self-proclaimed Mayor. Unseen by any of the populace and ruling the
city through his lackeys and cronies, he punishes those who go against
his will with mutilation, broken limbs, and assassination. Having ruled
the city for nearly a hundred years, there is much speculation as to
his identity. Some think he must be of a long-lived race, such as an
elf, gnome, or dwarf, while others say he&#8217;s a fabricated persona used
to protect the true leader of the Shadow Stalkers.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="druidic_order">Druidic Order</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Druidic Order was once an insular and fanatic group of druids, allowing
only the dryads, nymphs, and <a href="races.html#elves">elves</a> of
<a href="regions.html#sylvia">Sylvia</a> to join their ranks. In recent years, they&#8217;ve
begun sharing the secrets of the wild with the races of other realms, allowing
any who love and protect nature to become members of the Order and learn how
to commune with nature and take an animal&#8217;s form.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="sylvan_sisterhood">Sylvan Sisterhood</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Sylvan Sisterhood is a sect of dryads and nymphs that split off from the
<a href="#druidic_order">Druidic Order</a>. They protect nature with fierce zealotry,
cruelly punishing all who defile the forest of
<a href="regions.html#sylvia">Sylvia</a>. The Sisterhood draws their power from the
fey energy of the woods and <a href="gods.html#treofar">Treofar</a>, the Goddess of
Forests.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="daishu_temple">Daishu Temple</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Secluded high in the peaks of the
<a href="regions.html#sawtooth_mountains">Sawtooth Mountains</a>, disciples of
the Daishu Temple drink tea, study martial arts, practice Ki
meditation, and devote their minds to the philosophy of Tuaism.
<a href="gods.html#the_tua">Tua</a>, or <em>the Way</em>, is the harmony of
<a href="gods.html#tzen_and_tzing">Tzen and Tzing</a>, two
interdependent, natural forces that conserve universal balance. Tzen
energy manifests itself in heat, fire, air, electricity, light, day,
the sun, summer, up, and south, among other things. Tzing manifests in
cold, water, earth, acid, darkness, night, the moon, winter, down, and
north. These two forces are symbolized in the black and white halves of
the Face of Daishu, from which the Temple takes its name.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Because of the increased awareness they obtain through Ki meditation,
many fighting styles at the Temple have developed around both unarmed
attacks and exotic blades. Some disciples find their spirit naturally
resonates with Tzen or Tzing, and use their spiritual connection to
channel the elements. Others, through the power of meditation, have
acheived uncanny control over their body, enabling them to enhance
their agility when smoking spotted lotus leaves, or the tea made from
it.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="zek_yanrai">Zek Yanrai</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Founded by a psychic warrior named Amschel on the edge of a sea cliff, Zek
Yanrai is a temple that trains its members to hone their mind to a degree of
perfection unsurpassed by the people of any other realm in Noedia. This
discipline, called Psi, is such a potent force that the most powerful of
its practitioners can levitate objects with a thought and enter the minds of
less powerful beings.</p></div>
