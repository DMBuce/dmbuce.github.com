<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the year 241 AD, a powerful dragon named Keraptis rose from the dead,
threatening to destroy Death and take over the throne of the City of Death.
Keraptis was slain by Thrinnchild and his band of Dracolich Slayers before the
dragon could bring his plans to fruition. Thrinnchild and his companions went
their separate ways, each achieving greatness or infamy, depending on who you
ask.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Deisus Thrinnchild (Kruegs) sprouted wings and ascended to
<a href="gods.html#thrinn">Thrinn&#8217;s</a> side, serving as an angel under him.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Chiron Windhoof (Steve) returned to the <a href="regions.html#rolann">Rolanni
Plains</a>, serving as mediator and negotiating peace between the warring tribes
of Rolann. He later discovered a mysterious being known as
<a href="gods.html#the_mother_spirit">The Mother Spirit</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The half-dragon pirate Luca Grey (Benson) bought his own ship with the spoils
of Keraptis' treasure and sailed the Salt Sea with a crew of dragonkin.
Their descendents are known as the <a href="races.html#dragonborn">Dragonborn</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Amschel (Mersch) founded <a href="guilds.html#zek_yanrai">Zek Yanrai</a> in order to
teach others in the way of Psi.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tony V. (G-Man) joined the <a href="guilds.html#shadow_stalkers">Shadow Stalkers</a>
and overthrew its leader. Most of <a href="regions.html#traton">Traton</a> is now
under his control, and his influence extends throughout much of Noedia&#8217;s black
market.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A great necromancer (Nate) was among the heroes who slayed Keraptis,
but her name is lost to history. It is said that she slipped into the shadows
to serve <a href="gods.html#death">Death</a> in <a href="regions.html#necron_swamp">Necron
Swamp</a>.</p></div>
