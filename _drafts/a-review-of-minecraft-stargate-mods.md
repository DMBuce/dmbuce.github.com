I recently evaluated two Minecraft 1.12 mods,
Stargate Network (a.k.a. SGCraft) and AUNIS,
for a modpack I'm making. Here's what I found.

### Methods & Motivation

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Here's the differences between the two mods that I found notable:

| SGCraft | AUNIS |
|---------|-------|
| Has a Pegasus portal | Has a Universe portal |
| Portal is easier to build (square, no directionality) | Portal is bigger |
| Less JEI clutter, fewer pointless upgrades | More fluid crafting, microcrafting |
| UI is easier to access and interact with | UI is more immersive |
| You can camouflage the portal's base | You can camouflage most of the portal's base |
| ComputerCraft integration | Built-in exploration mechanic (Mysterious Pages) |
| Photorealistic textures | Cleaner textures |

SGCraft Pros:
* Can type dialing sequence on keyboard
* Both UIs are accessible from any side
* You can reskin portals with an upgrade, no need to rebuild

### StarGate Setup

### StarGate Usage

### StarGate Upgrades

### Other Blocks & Items

### Conclusion

If you like immersive UIs,
want a stargate mod that requires some infrastructure,
AUNIS is probably right up your alley.

If you prefer simple UIs,
need ComputerCraft integration,
